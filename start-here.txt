The goal of this Claude Code project is to create Recurrent Neural
Network tools for PatientGraph. 

PatientGraph is a knowledge graph, using the graph database
AllegroGraph that combines patient data from the Synthea Project, FDA
clinical trials, some Pubmed literature about Covid, and the VAERs
database. Everything in this knowledge graph is tied together by UMLS
taxonomies.

In another project we (claude and I) created a very sophisticated
system to create queries and do analytics against AllegroGraph. The
full project is in the softlink in this directory called
GraphTalker. Please study the code in that directory to understand how
this software. You might want to start in this directory with
./graphtalker/CLAUDE.md and ./graphtalker/docs/AGENT-GUIDE.md

Ask the user to start graphtalker, although you can do it yourself by
starting ~/dropboxlisp/claude-mcp-in-lisp/start-server.sh 8080 (or
whatever open port you chose)

Once that is up, please use graphtalker to ask about the structure of
patientgraph. Please execute the following instructions via the eval
server:
(initialize-agraph-connection "http" "localhost" 10035 ""
"PatientGraph" "test" "xyzzy")

(test-agraph-connection)

(claude-query "Tell me the structure of the database in great detail")

Once you have done that I want you to read the local file "README.md"
That file is the result of asking claude how we could build a system
for recurrent neural networks for patientgraph and it came up with
this suggestion. Please le me know if you also think this is a good
plan.
